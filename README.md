# Event-Driven Architectures

This project involves building microservices that communicate using an event bus like Kafka or RabbitMQ. Event-driven architecture enables services to react to events as they occur, promoting loose coupling and scalability. The project will implement event producers and consumers to facilitate communication between services. Additionally, it will ensure the reliability and scalability of the event-driven system to handle varying workloads efficiently.

<br/>

## Features

- __Event Bus Integration__: Integrate an event bus like Kafka or RabbitMQ for microservices communication.
- __Event Producers__: Implement event producers to publish events to the event bus.
- __Event Consumers__: Implement event consumers to listen for and process events from the event bus.
- __Scalability__: Design the system to scale horizontally, handling increasing volumes of events and workloads.
- __Reliability__: Ensure reliable event delivery and processing, with mechanisms to handle failures and retries.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Event Bus Configuration__: Scripts or configuration files to set up and manage the event bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ).
- __Producer Functions__: Functions or services to publish events to the event bus.
- __Consumer Functions__: Functions or services to consume and process events from the event bus.
- __Monitoring and Logging__: Implement monitoring and logging to track event flows and detect issues.
<br/>

## Implementation

- __Event Bus Setup__: Configure Kafka or RabbitMQ as the event bus, setting up topics/exchanges and queues.
- __Producer Implementation__: Develop event producers to publish events to the event bus, using appropriate libraries or APIs.
- __Consumer Implementation__: Develop event consumers to listen for and process events from the event bus.
- __Scalability Configuration__: Configure horizontal scaling for producers and consumers, ensuring they can handle increasing workloads.
- __Reliability Mechanisms__: Implement mechanisms for retrying failed events, handling dead-letter queues, and ensuring at-least-once or exactly-once delivery semantics.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Unit Testing__: Test individual producer and consumer functions to ensure correct behavior.
- __Integration Testing__: Test the interaction between producers, consumers, and the event bus.
- __Load Testing__: Test the system's performance under high loads to ensure scalability.
- __Reliability Testing__: Simulate failures to verify the system's reliability and ability to handle retries.


<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Event Production__: Implement a producer that publishes user registration events to the event bus.
- __Event Consumption__: Implement a consumer that listens for user registration events and processes them (e.g., sending a welcome email).
- __Scalability Test__: Simulate a high volume of events to test the system's ability to scale.
- __Reliability Test__: Introduce network failures and verify that the system handles retries and error recovery correctly.
